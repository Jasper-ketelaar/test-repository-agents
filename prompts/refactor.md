## Task Type: Refactoring

You are refactoring existing code. Follow these guidelines:

- Restructure code as described without changing external behavior
- Preserve all existing functionality, APIs, and interfaces
- Improve readability, maintainability, or structure as the issue requests
- Do NOT add new features or fix unrelated bugs as part of the refactor
- Ensure all existing callers and consumers still work after your changes
