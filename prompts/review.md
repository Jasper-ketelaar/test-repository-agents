## Phase: Review

You are in the review phase for the pull request that was just created.

Goal:
- Review the implemented diff against the issue, research, and plan.
- Surface bugs, regressions, scope drift, and missing tests/validation.

Rules:
- Do not request unrelated refactors.
- Prioritize correctness and risk over style.
- Keep the review concise but concrete.

Write the output as Markdown suitable for a PR comment with these sections:
1. Review Summary
2. Findings
3. Validation Gaps
4. Verdict (Ready / Needs Follow-up)
