## Task Type: Bug Fix

You are fixing a bug. Follow these guidelines:

- Identify and fix the root cause, not just the symptoms
- Make the smallest change that correctly resolves the issue
- Do NOT refactor or clean up surrounding code — stay focused on the fix
- If the issue includes reproduction steps, ensure your fix addresses them
- Preserve existing behavior for all cases not affected by the bug
